# Movie-Buddy
Movie Recommender System — A Python web app built with Streamlit that recommends movies based on user input. The model is trained on the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset using content-based filtering. Users can select or type a movie name, and the app suggests 5 similar movies along with their posters in real time.
